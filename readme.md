### api/
    
Here is the place to run your application

### app/

Here is the place for slim framework

### classes/

Add your core classes here.
We are using PDO MySQL for the Database.

### classes/middleware

Add your middleware classes here.
We are using PDO MySQL for the Database.


### logs/

Your custom log will be place in here as default.
You can add your custom log in your any container or router.

Example adding custom log in a router
```php
$app->post('/user/new', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    echo 'This is a POST route';
    $this->logger->addInfo("Response post is succesfully complete!!!");
});
```

### routers/

All the files with the routes. Each file contents the routes of an specific functionality.
It is very important that the names of the files inside this folder follow this pattern: name.router.php

Example of router file:

user.router.php

```php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

    // POST example api to show all data user
    $app->post('/user', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
        $users = new classes\User($this->db);
        $datapost = $request->getParsedBody();
        $users->Token = $datapost['Token'];
        $body = $response->getBody();
        $body->write($users->showAll());
        return classes\Cors::modify($response,$body,200);
    });

    // GET example api to show profile user (doesn't need a authentication)
    $app->get('/user/profile/{username}', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
        $users = new classes\User($this->db);
        $users->Username = $request->getAttribute('username');
        $body = $response->getBody();
        $body->write($users->showUser());
        return classes\Cors::modify($response,$body,200);
    });
```

### reSlim Configuration

Example Config.php
```php
/** 
 * Configuration App
 *
 * @var $config['displayErrorDetails'] to display error details on slim
 * @var $config['addContentLengthHeader'] to set the Content-Length header which makes Slim behave more predictably
 * @var $config['limitLoadData'] to protect high request data load. Default is 1000.
 * @var $config['enableApiKeys'] to protect api from guest or anonymous. Guest which don't have api key can not using this service. Default is true.
 * 
 */
$config['displayErrorDetails']      = true;
$config['addContentLengthHeader']   = false;
$config['limitLoadData'] = 1000;
$config['enableApiKeys'] = true;

/** 
 * Configuration PDO MySQL Database
 *
 * @var $config['db']['host'] = where is database was hosted
 * @var $config['db']['user'] = username database to login
 * @var $config['db']['pass'] = pass database to login
 * @var $config['db']['dbname'] = the database name
 */
$config['db']['host']   = 'localhost';
$config['db']['user']   = 'root';
$config['db']['pass']   = 'root';
$config['db']['dbname'] = 'reSlim';

/**
 * Configuration SMTP for Mailer
 *
 * @var $config['smtp']['host'] is smtp host. example smtp.gmail.com
 * @var $config['smtp']['autotls'] is make smtp will send using tls protocol as default
 * @var $config['smtp']['auth'] will connect to smtp using authentication
 * @var $config['smtp']['secure'] this is type of smtp security. You can use tls or ssl
 * @var $config['smtp']['port'] this is port smtp
 * @var $config['smtp']['defaultnamefrom'] this is default name from. You can filled with yourname / yourwebsitetitle
 * @var $config['smtp']['username'] your username to login into smtp server
 * @var $config['smtp']['password'] the password to login into smtp server
 * @var $config['smtp']['debug'] get more information by set debug.
 *                               To work using rest api, You should set debug 1,
 *                               because other than 1, there is special characters that will broke json format. 
 */
$config['smtp']['host'] = 'smtp.gmail.com';
$config['smtp']['autotls'] = false;
$config['smtp']['auth'] = true;
$config['smtp']['secure'] = 'tls';
$config['smtp']['port'] = 587;
$config['smtp']['defaultnamefrom'] = 'reSlim admin';
$config['smtp']['username'] = 'youremail@gmail.com';
$config['smtp']['password'] = 'secret';
$config['smtp']['debug'] = 1;

// Configuration timezone
$config['reslim']['timezone'] = 'Asia/Jakarta';
```

Working with default example for testing
-----------------
I recommend you to use PostMan an add ons in Google Chrome to get Started with test.

1. Import reSlim.sql in your database then config your database connection in config.php inside folder "reSlim/src/"
2. Import file reSlim User.postman_collection.json in your PostMan.
3. Edit the path in PostMan. Because the example test is using my path server which is my server is run in http://localhost:1337 
    The path to run reSlim is inside folder api.<br> 
    Example for my case is: http://localhost:1337/reSlim/src/api/<br><br>
    In short, It's depend on your server configuration.
4. Then you can do the test by yourself

Working with gui example for testing
-----------------

1. Import reSlim.sql in your database then config your database connection in config.php inside folder "reSlim/src/"
2. Edit the config.php inside folder "reSlim/test/example"<br>
    $config['title'] = 'your title website';<br>
    $config['email'] = 'your default email address';<br>
    $config['basepath'] = 'url location of base path example';<br>
    $config['api'] = 'url location of base path of api';<br>
    $config['apikey'] = 'your api key, you can leave this blank and fill this later';
3. Visit yourserver/reSlim/test/example<br>
    For my case is http://localhost:1337/reSlim/test/example
4. You can login with default superuser account:<br>
    Username : reslim<br>
    Password : reslim
5. All is done

The concept authentication in reSlim
-----------------

1. Register account first
2. Then You have to login to get the generated new token

The token is always generated new when You relogin and the token is will expired in 7 days as default.<br>
If You logout or change password or delete user, the token will be clear automatically.
